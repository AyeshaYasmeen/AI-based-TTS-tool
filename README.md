# AI-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) Tool

This project is an AI-powered Text-to-Speech (TTS) tool that supports multiple languages and voices. 
It utilizes **Coqui TTS**, an open-source library, to generate natural-sounding speech from text input. 
The tool allows users to choose between English and French languages and outputs the generated audio in `.wav` format.

## Features
- **AI-based Speech Generation**: Uses pre-trained models (Tacotron2) for natural-sounding speech.
- **Multi-language Support**: Currently supports English and French.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` for package installation
- `ffmpeg` installed and added to the system path (required for audio processing)
